<h1><center>CSS postions and Grid Layout</center></h1>

    <!-- Positions

        1.Static - It is default position.

        2.Relative - Similar to static but we can change postion by Top,Bottom,Left & Right. 

        3.Fixed - It is used to Fix something at a position (used to fix Icons like Whatsapp/call on webpage)
                  The problem is it doesnt leave a Space when fixed. The other elements get hidden into the fixed element.
        
        4.Sticky - It is used instead of Fixed as it leaves some Blank Space between the Element.
                   It behaves as a toggle between Relative and Fixed depending on the scroll position.
                   It is used according to Scroll position. Bheaves as Relative until it hit Scroll position.
                   It doesnt leave any space once it is Fixed.

        5.Absoulute - This allows objects to be placed one on top of another.
                      By Absoulute and Relative we can place the Element relative to Parent Object.
